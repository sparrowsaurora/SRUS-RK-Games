# Portfolio Assessment knowledge questions

## Step 1 - What sorting is
> Sorting is the act or process of ordering that of which is assorted (not in order). sorting can mean putting things, in ascending, descending, or any other set order. Sorting items helps with organisation and efficiency, and aesthetic in everyday situations.

## Step 2 - Research sorting algorithms
> Bubble sort - simple to understand but inefficient or larger pieces of information due to its O(n^2) time complexity.  
> Quick sort - fast with O(n log n) time complexity and great in larger datasets  but can end up being O(n^2) if not implemented correctly. (good pivot point strategies can mitigate this risk)  
> Merge sort - is more memory intensive however, it's very fast ( O(n log n)) great for larger datasets

## Step 3 - Why you generally need comparison when Sorting
> generally sorting algorithms use comparison operations to find an objects place in a list. however this is not strictly necessary in some cases like a qualitative ordering system or one could write a sorting system without using comparison by instead using key based methods which don't directly compare objects
